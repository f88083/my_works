# What are the files?

They are the critical codes that I wrote for Network Simulator 3. 
Some of them were base on the existing model, such as the codes for the AODV and DSDV protocols.
Bash scripts were created by my own.

# How to find my codes?

If you'd like to view the codes for the attacks (Blackhole, Flooding),
just press ctrl-f to search for keywords "blackhole" or "flooding".

# What is resultGetter folder for?

They are the scripts that I used to parse and draw charts of the result from Network Simulator 3.
